        emergency:'Burns',
        steps:["Flush the burned area with cool running water for several minutes. Do not use ice.",
            "Apply a light gauze bandage" ,"If the burn is minor, you can put on an ointment, like aloe vera, before you cover it.",
            "Take Motrin (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen) for pain relief if you need it.",
            "Do not break any blisters that form."]
    },
    {emergency:"Stopped Heart",
     steps:["Find a person nearby. Make eye contact, point to them, and say: Call 102.",
        "Start doing chest compressions on the person who needs help.",
        " Using both your hands, push down hard and fast in the center of the person’s chest. Let their chest come back up naturally between compressions. You may hear pops or snaps; this is normal.",
        "Keep going until someone with more training arrives.",
        "If you’re trained in CPR, you can use chest compressions and rescue breathing."]

{
    emergency:"Bleeding",
    steps:["Put on disposable gloves if you have them. This will protect you from infectious diseases like viral hepatitis and HIV/AIDS that can be spread in a person’s blood.",
   "Rinse the wound with water.",
   " Cover the wound with a gauze or cloth (e.g., towel, blanket, clothing).",
    "Apply direct pressure to stop the flow of blood and encourage clotting (when blood naturally thickens to stop blood loss).",
    "Elevate the bleeding body part above the person’s heart if you can.",
    "Do not remove the cloth if it becomes soaked. Removing the first layer will interfere with the clotting process and result in more blood loss. Instead, add more layers if needed.",
    "Once bleeding has stopped, put a clean bandage on the wound."]
},
{ emergency:"Choking",
 steps:["Stand behind the person and lean them slightly forward.",
 "Put your arms around their waist.",
 "Clench your fist and place it between their abdomen and rib cage.",
 "Grab your fist with your other hand.",
 "Pull your clenched fist sharply backward and upward under the person’s rib cage in five quick thrusts.",
 "Repeat until the object is coughed up.",
 "For someone who is obese or pregnant, perform the thrusts around the chest instead of the abdomen."]
},
 {emergency:"Blisters",
  steps:["Wash your hands.",
  "Sterilize a needle with alcohol.",
  "Make small holes at the edge of the blister.",
  "Gently push out the fluid.",
  "Apply antibiotic ointment.",
  "Put on a bandage.",
 "If possible, take steps to protect the area from further rubbing or pressure."]
 },
 { emergency:"Sprains",
 steps:["Keep the limb as still as possible.",
 "Apply a cold pack.",
 "Elevate the injured part if you can do so safely.",
 "Use Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs for pain."]
},
{ emergency:"Nosebleed",
steps:["Lean slightly forward, not back.",
    "Pinch the nose just below the bridge. It needs to be high enough that the nostrils are not pinched closed.",
    "After five minutes, check to see if the bleeding has stopped. If not, continue pinching and check after another 10 minutes.",
    "Apply a cold pack to the bridge of the nose while you’re pinching."]
},
{ emergency:"Fracture",
steps:["Do not try to straighten the bone.",
    "For a limb, use a splint and padding to keep it still, then elevate it.",
    "Put a cold pack on the injury—but not directly on the skin. Use a barrier between the ice and the skin to keep the tissue from being damaged. If all you have is ice, put it in a plastic bag and wrap it in a shirt or towel before applying it.",
    "Give the person anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen for pain."]
