    title:"It’s Ok and Be Kind to Yourself About it.",
    text:"That’s it. That’s my main message.  It’s ok and be kind to yourself. I spend a lot of time writing, blogging, speaking, and podcasting this simple message. I say it hundreds of different ways but it’s all boiled down to this: No matter what you are feeling about anything, it’s ok and just be kind to yourself about it.These are straightforward instructions that are close to impossible to heed. Even as I hear them come out of my mouth every day, I struggle to remember or practice them. My big feelings never feel ok and being kind to myself is an absolute struggle on a daily basis.Big feelings are difficult to feel and understand.Listen, I get it. When we are swimming with sharks it’s hard to see the shore. And when we are exhausted and scared it’s hard to tell ourselves it’s ok. And when we make mistakes or we are trying to fix everything we tend to beat ourselves up and not be kind to ourselves.Thank goodness I signed up for caring for my parents when I did. Caregiving was my wake-up call. I had to learn to navigate my big feelings because the lives of those I cared for demanded I be a better me and a better caregiver. I had to find new ways to cope with what I was feeling so I could be present for what they were feeling. It was during my caregiving journey that I began to see the importance of understanding that no matter what I was feeling or the outcome, it was ok and I needed to be kind to myself.For most of my life, I hid, stuffed, and tried to get rid of my feelings. Especially the big ones. They are SO uncomfortable. I always wanted them to go away as quickly as possible. It was a blueprint for disaster. I would do all sorts of things to make myself instantly feel better and never resolve what was going on. There is no quick fix to big feelings. We call them big for a reason. It takes time and effort to get around them.Sitting with our feelings is a huge challenge.I often have to wait around while the big feelings crash around in my head and heart and freak me out and scare me. Sometimes they make me feel extremely sad and hopeless and no matter how hard I try, I can’t shake them off. Yet I’ve learned to stick with them, believing my soul will rebound and work hard to make whatever repair is necessary. I try to remember that the sun will come up tomorrow and that everything’s ok.As for being kind to myself, I am a work in progress. Self-kindness is something I’m getting better at but it’s not my usual go-to. I have to work hard at it. The critic in my head feels like the factory preset that constantly needs resetting. The results are often touch and go and I find it difficult but I’m slowly but surely getting used to knowing what being kind to myself feels like. It’s like being my own best friend who is reassuring me that I’m doing a great job, I’m special and wonderful.  I’m working on everything as fast as I can and no one deserves a break more than me.Big feelings go with the territory.So the next time you are in the thick of some big scary, painful feeling, please remember it’s ok to be in it and be so very kind to yourself. This is the recipe for treading water until you can see the shore and find safety, relief, and rest. Caregiving is hard. You are going to have big reactions to it and  huge waves of emotions wash over you. But you are allowed to have those big feelings and you will learn to sit with them and work through them. It’s healthy and good to seek help to go through this process, and it’s a perfect opportunity to learn what being kind to yourself feels like. You are a kindness machine, so spend some of that kindness on you. "

title:"A once virile, passionate Italian was now void of all emotion",
text:"My name is Lisa. I’m a baby boomer and so was my childhood sweetheart. We met at 15, and dated until we were married in 1966, just turning 20 years old. We were born in August, and chose that month to marry as well. A lot of celebrating for two Leos.Our life began rather simply. Living and working in San Francisco, but wanting to start a family, we decided to buy a home in the burbs.We bumped along as a young, married couple with children in those years. We had two daughters, two dogs, and one house.  I got my teaching degree and Richard became a fireman.  Life was anything but quiet. We were both FBI’s (Full-Blooded Italians), and couldn’t speak without using our hands, and were passionate about the things we loved.It was 1998 and I began to notice that Richard’s scent smelled differently to me than what I was used to. His personality was changing as well. When he retired in late 2000, it was then that I could definitely see and smell that something was wrong with my husband.His memory was fading; he became directionally dysfunctional, and couldn’t remember any dates or days of the week. We began to seek help, all to no avail. Richard took a mini-mental test and passed. We visited more psychiatrists, who gave him medication for all kinds of mental issues. None hit the target.ore chaos at home was brewing. He became incontinent, and had to be watched closely. I began to have heart problems and would frequent the ER often. I, too, was getting sick, as many caregivers suffer health problems while caring for another. I felt such sadness, that our relationship had changed dramatically. This once virile, good-looking Italian guy, it seemed, was losing ground faster than a landslide.Our personal physician had Richard take a CT scan, and when the doctor gave us the report, he cried; then I cried.  It showed his brain had shrunk, and white mass was present. He suggested we take a class on Alzheimer’s and see how we felt about it.We attended the two-hour class with about 15 other patients and their caregivers. Everyone in the room was over 75-years-old. Here we sat, in our 50’s, and Richard was stone-faced, while tears kept streaming down my face. I couldn’t stop the flow. When we left the class, I couldn’t believe this could happen to us. It was like a tsunami hit us. I felt hopeless and helpless. Both of us had strong faith in the Lord, and that was what I clung to as we struggled with daily tasks that were once done without thought.I hired a caregiver, Amelia, with the help of Family Caregiver Alliance. They came to our aid with open arms and said, “We’re here to help you.” Those words resonated in my heart and soul. What powerful and wonderful words to hear. We also attended Early-Onset Alzheimer’s classes, and met with the caregivers only. A bond formed that continues to this day.Another explosion would take us to our knees. Our home caught on fire and was considered a total loss. All three of us spent the next three weeks in a hotel. Richard had now lost all memories, face recognitions, and spoke very little. I was forced to place him in a facility that catered to this horrendous disease. Nearly 40 years together, we now had to separate. More sorrow, more misery, and more grief. I visited Richard daily, but he regressed and didn’t respond to me. He was void of all emotions. My heart was broken.Richard passed away eight months later.  I miss Richard so very much, as do my children and grandchildren. His death left a huge void in our lives. My soul mate is now in God’s hands."

title:"Being a Survivor of a Survivor: A Mom’s Firsts",
text:"This blog is dedicated to my fellow brave survivors of survivors who are still standing while living and learning through our firsts. The firsts that we never saw coming, let alone survive. I have written about my son Steven’s firsts in a previous blog post. Steven’s list of firsts is long. He was in a near-fatal car crash in 2012, leaving him with a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Steven was faced with learning to live life again from infancy to adulthood, but the most devastating first was having to learn to navigate life without his brother, his best friend, Aaron, who didn’t survive the crash.Recently, during a counseling session, the topic of Steven’s journey came up. I found myself going down memory lane of how far he’s come and talking about all of his firsts and how brave he is. My counselor listened intently. I know her well enough to recognize when her counseling wheels are turning in the direction of doing some extra unpacking, as she calls it. I call it dread because it puts the focus on me. She asked if I had ever processed the reality that I, too, lived deeply each of those firsts with Steven while also compiling a list of my own firsts. Tears flowed as we unpacked this realization. As a survivor of a survivor, my most devastating first was hearing the words, “Your sons were in a car crash. Your son Aaron didn’t survive. Your son Steven isn’t expected to survive.” It took a very long time for me to absorb those words … words that erased so many hopes of what my firsts as a mom to my adult children were supposed to look like. I went into survival mode, putting my own needs and recovery on hold to stay focused on Steven as he recovered, cheering him on as he bravely conquered all his firstsOne of the repercussions of living on auto pilot for years is the fact that my own needs got filed away with a to-be-determined date for unpacking. As I very slowly began the process, I experienced a landslide of emotions as all the firsts played through my mind like a slow-motion video reel, reminding me that I never allowed myself to process the firsts that I survived as a mother losing one son and almost losing another. A first that no parent wants to face is planning a Celebration of Life for their child while watching another child struggle to stay alive in the ICU. These are firsts we will never forget.Further down the list of firsts was putting my comfortable career on hold while stepping into the unknown role of caregiver, a position for which I had no qualifications. I had to accept that my then shy, reserved voice needed to evolve into a get-your-attention voice to advocate for Steven in what would be years of recovery. Doing so definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone. Steven lives with TBI coupled with epilepsy, which is a result of his brain injury. It was less painful for me to focus on Steven’s diagnosis and recovery than to face my own firsts. I didn’t want PTSD, anxiety, panic attacks, and sleep deprivation. I’m Steven’s caregiver, after all; how could I possibly have time to deal with my own issues? Diagnoses like PTSD, anxiety, and panic attacks can also come with shame, but through counseling, I am slowly learning that I must let go of that shame. These are real medical diagnoses, not self-inflicted labels. I am thankful for knowledgeable and patient medical professionals and I cling to my faith and to my village for love, support, and encouragement. And the life lessons that I learn daily from my firsts help me help other survivors, reminding them that we are not alone. On the positive side — because there is always a positive side if we dig deep enough! — without being a survivor of a survivor, I would not have discovered my desire to write publicly. I wouldn’t have taken the brave step to learn a new career, which has introduced me to an amazing work family. And I wouldn’t be volunteering with our trauma family at the hospital to which Steven was airlifted. These steps are positive reminders that I’m also on my road to recovery — alongside my amazing son, Steven. "
